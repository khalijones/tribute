    <p>
      As a software engineering student, I admire Muhammad Ali not only for his strength but for his mindset. He taught me that greatness begins with self-belief — to say “I am the greatest” even before achieving it. In coding and problem-solving, resilience and confidence matter most. His courage to stand for his values inspires me to face challenges with integrity, discipline, and persistence — both in life and in tech.
